Sci-Hub has grown rapidly since its creation in 2011, but the extent of its coverage has been unclear. Here we report that, as of March 2017, Sci-Hub’s database contains 68.9% of the 81.6 million scholarly articles registered with Crossref and 85.1% of articles published in toll access journals. We find that coverage varies by discipline and publisher, and that Sci-Hub preferentially covers popular, paywalled content. For toll access articles, we find that Sci-Hub provides greater coverage than the University of Pennsylvania, a major research university in the United States. Green open access to toll access articles via licit services, on the other hand, remains quite limited. Our interactive browser at https://greenelab.github.io/scihub allows users to explore these findings in more detail. For the first time, nearly all scholarly literature is available gratis to anyone with an Internet connection, suggesting the toll access business model may become unsustainable."

Sci-Hub access logs were combined from two releases: (Elbakyan and Bohannon, 2016) covering 27,819,963 downloads from September 2015 to February 2016 and (Tzovaras, 2018) covering 150,875,862 downloads from 2017. The plot shows the average number of downloads per day for months with data. There were 54 days within the collection periods without any logged access events, due presumably to service outages or server misconfiguration. Hence, we ignored days without logs when computing monthly averages. Point color indicates the proportion of days with logs for a given month. For example, November 2015 and October 2017, which were missing logs for 17 and 23 days respectively, are thus lighter. The December 2017 dropoff in downloads likely reflects the effect of domain suspensions that occurred in late November (Silver, 2017). Unlike the Sci-Hub log analyses elsewhere in this study, this plot does not filter for valid articles (i.e. DOIs in our Crossref-derived catalog of scholarly literature)."

Each diagram shows the coverage of three access methods and their possible combinations. Within a diagram, each section notes the percent coverage achieved by the corresponding combination of access methods. Contrary to traditional Venn diagrams, each section does not indicate disjoint sets of articles. Instead, each section shows coverage on the same set of articles, whose total number is reported in the diagram’s title. The top two diagrams show coverage on a small set of manually evaluated articles (confidence intervals provided in the main text). The bottom two diagrams show coverage on a larger set of automatically evaluated articles. The two lefthand diagrams show coverage on all articles, whereas the two righthand diagrams show coverage on toll access articles only. Specifically, the top-right diagram assesses coverage on articles that were inaccessible from outside of an institutional network. Similarly, the bottom-right diagram assesses coverage of articles that were classified as closed or green by oaDOI, and thus excludes gold, hybrid, and bronze articles (those available gratis from their publisher)."

For example, this plot shows that 75% of articles published in 2011 were uploaded to LibGen within 60 months. This analysis only considers articles for which a month of publication can reliably be extracted, which excludes all articles allegedly published on January 1. This plot portrays lag-times as decreasing over time, with maximum coverage declining. For example, coverage for 2016 articles exceeded 50% within 6 months, but appears to have reached an asymptote around 60%. Alternatively, coverage for 2014 took 15 months to exceed 50%, but has since reached 75%. However, this signal could result from post-dated LibGen upload timestamps. Therefore, we caution against drawing any conclusions from the TimeAdded field in LibGen scimag until its accuracy can be established more reliably."
