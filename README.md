# underground
The Underlay Playground - a set of experimental tools for building and browsing underlays. 

Current tools include those for discovering and creating assertions, and for viewing and traversing their knowledge- and provenance-graphs.

# Usage
Download this directory, unzip it, and run a local webserver in the directory.  The index page will give you the option to load in assertion files, which will generate nodes displayed in some order as you do so.  

Links within a node point to other nodes; clicking on those links will add the target nodes to the display.
